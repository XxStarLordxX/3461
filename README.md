# Parking-Permit-Kiosk

A simple GUI program developed by java swing. This program simulates the process of 
purchasing a parking permit on a parking kiosk with touch-screen. As a result, all the
intereaction are be done by using mouse, which simulates users' "touching" behaviors.

There are two txt files which indicates the valid users who have the access to this 
system and the names of available insurance companies respectively. The program must 
read these files at beginning to function properly.
